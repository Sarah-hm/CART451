    <h1>Reading responses</h1>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
   <h3> short bio prompt</h3>
 <p>There is very few autobiographical things I could say, write, or make that you would not in some ways already know about. One thing I have left is a (possibly non-exhaustive) list of the times I got in trouble throughout my entire school career, starting with: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In first grade, I got up during an exam because my friend was confused about a question and I really wanted to help her. I barely understood why my teacher got mad and made a report for my mom to sign (my mom laughed a lot, though);
        </li>
        <li>
            I got another report-to-be-signed-by-mom in 4-ish grade from kicking my guy best friend after he had told me something incredibly stupid (mom laughed again); 
        </li>
        <li>
            I got sent in the hallway in 6th grade because I was talking too damn much;
        </li>
        <li>
            In grade 7, a teacher gave a better grade to a student I had given my homework to, to copy. I asked her why that person had gotten a better grade than me since it was the same assignment, so I obviously got detention for that; 
        </li>
        <li>
            So many detentions for reading in class; 
        </li>
        <li>
            So many more for my poor early procrastination skills; 
        </li>
        <li>
            Teachers would keep moving me in the classroom in poor attempts to get me to stop talking, to no avail; 
        </li>
        <li>
            The one where I didn't get in caught: I brought (my first and only) cheat sheet to an exam in my first years of cegep. I was so scared of getting caught, I never used it and left it in my jeans. I still remember how stressed I was walking out from the room, scared the teacher would find the sheet that I hadn't even looked at once;
        </li>
        <li>
            In fashion school, I got 0 on an assignment and a note to my file because a classmate had lost his illustrator files needed for part of an assignment, and I had sent mine to him. He didn't modify them, so we got caught for plagiarism. My friends would crack a joke about it every time we would go over syllabus at the beginning of the semesters. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You choose how you want to interpret (I won't cheat though, I have learned my lessons)</p>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h3>the 'sheep market' experiment explained through Jeff Howe's 'The rise of crowdsourcing' lens</h3>
    <p>I find the 'sheep market' to be a very humorous, yet staggeringly clear depiction of what 'the rise of crowdsourcing' author, Jeff Howe, is demonstrating in his text. In a lot of ways, namely Amazon's Mechanical Turk, explained in the article and exemplified in the 'sheep market' experiment/piece, crowdsourcing can undeniably come to the expense of expertise and skills; however, this is arguably made by intentional design. By simplifying the process of creation, may it be professional stock photos or physics and chemistry 'challenges', the crowdsourcing model is able to come down to elementary and structured steps that are easier, quicker and much more efficient to complete, even for someone with little to no background in whichever activity they are meant to perform. The process of crowdsourced labor tasks like the ones previously mentioned come down to anthropomorphizing the assembly line; making every steps of a project as easily manageable by virtually anyone. </p>
<p>In the 'sheep market' experiment/piece, the 10,000 workers exemplify this by drawing a "sheep facing left" in as little time as possible in order to collect their 0,02$. For the makers of 'sheep market', crowdsourcing comes down to 'you get what you pay for', for the better or the worse. The experiment does not seem to draw any conclusion or even opinion from the results, rather suggesting it exists merely to expose what it is you get when you want to pay this kind of money. The signal-to-noise being rather small (10,000 satisfying results, for only 662 rejected ones) may seem to encourage such labor models, while the subjective definition of what is in fact qualified as 'satisfying result' may reflect instead what 0,02$ labor is actually worth, and critiquing the crowdsourcing model for lowered quality work. 
</p>


<h2>Week 6</h2>
<h3>Experimental Data Visualization: examining Sepandar D. Kamvar and Jonathan Harris' We Feel Fine and Mimi Onuoha's Missing Data Sets data visualization projects</h3>
<p>Mimi Onuoha's project could be considered a great example of low-tech experimental data visualization. We often talk, examine, and critically analyze data we do have, sometimes (often) pulling conclusions from biased research methodologies (Onuoha, 2016). To critically oppose this (mis)representation of (faulty) data, Onuoha makes Missing data sets take up real life space in a file cabinet, which contains empty files all tagged with different and unique datasets that were never collected (data sets) . Often dealing with sexism, classism, racism and ableism, the missing datasets exemplify a reality we often talk about through words only. Having a palpable experience of these non-things or non-data is a good way to "communicate through example", as Sepandar D. Kamvar and Jonathan Harris would put it. The We Feel Fine project rather uses an outpour of data, that of the word "feel" or "feeling", and indexes it to better visualize it. Both projects are very different in collection methodologies, but both have a similar goal of "influencing affect rather than cognition" (Kamvar and Harris, 2011). Little knowledge can be extracted from Onuoha's missing data sets other than the deafening absence of any actual information on the chosen topics; We Feel Fine's entire goal is to have people interact emotionally with other internet users' own emotions. In their own ways, both projects have the goal of 'gripping' their viewers and users with strong emotions about their respective themes. Onuoha also encourages "direct interaction with individual data items" (Kamvar and Harris, 2011)), as the file cabinet can be interacted with, opened, and browsed by nearby viewers. Rather than being out of touch and hard to grasp, every entry can be individually interacted with, creating that much more affect about one (or more) topic that reading an article about its underrepresentation would entail. This public interaction with the art piece aligns with the micro/macro interaction principles the We Feel Fine creators abide by; for viewers to be able to see the data in its entirety, but also interact with it on an individual and personally affected basis.

With the loss of food starting at the production level and considering a future where our extractive practices will no longer be a viable resource, the future of food is material production. Subject of object permanence, re-entering these raw materials into the stream of consciousness is the idea of something being even when out of sight, with collective capitalism strategically maneuvering of masking waste production, where the transmission of information about material production goes into a faulty telephone game situation where details get dropped. Revisiting food futures, near and far, possible and plausible, through the material properties of our diet and seasonal demands of such materials. I’m interested in tying this project to culture and community by analyzing culinary practices as methodologies to approach this material. I’m particularly interested in the science of breadmaking, looking between successes and failures as potentials.
